# Compiler Design for Protocol Specification Language in C

This repository contains the implementation of a compiler for a Protocol Specification Language (PSL) in C. The project aims to develop a robust system for parsing, analyzing, and optimizing communication protocols. It includes three main components: a lexical analyzer, a syntax and semantic analyzer, and an intermediate code generator.

## Introduction
A lexical analyzer for a Protocol Specification Language (PSL) is crucial for enabling users to define communication protocols systematically. This analyzer processes input text to produce tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and literals based on predefined grammar rules. It categorizes these tokens, identifies components like message types, fields, data structures, and headers, and maintains a symbol table for tracking identifiers and their attributes. The analyzer also includes error handling mechanisms to detect and report syntax errors, ensuring effective debugging. The system undergoes testing, validation, and optimization to ensure efficiency and accuracy. This foundational component is integrated into a broader system for parsing and processing protocols, supported by thorough documentation and maintenance.

### Lexical Analyzer
The lexical analyzer breaks down input text into tokens following PSL grammar rules. It identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, and other components, maintaining a symbol table and implementing error handling mechanisms.

### Syntax and Semantic Analyzer
The syntax and semantic analyzer processes tokens generated by the lexical analyzer. It ensures that the PSL specifications are syntactically and semantically correct, producing an intermediate representation for further optimization.

### Intermediate Code Generator
The intermediate code generator takes the output of the syntax and semantic analyzer and generates optimized intermediate code. This code is intended for efficient execution or further processing by protocol-related applications.
